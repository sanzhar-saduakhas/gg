# game-from-a-to-z

The letters are displayed in random order on the screen, the game starts from the moment you press the first letter of the russian alphabet - “A” (the timer starts). The essence of the game is to go through the sequence A-> Б-> В-> Г ...-> Я as quickly as possible. By pressing the final letter of the alphabet - "Я" the game ends (the timer stops and the result is displayed - the time spent on the adventure of the game). When you click on the letter corresponding to the current value, it changes to a random letter necessary to continue the chain. If the letters are over, the cell becomes empty. Also, the result is written to the database, and the top time scores are displayed in the corresponding page. The history of all attempts made by a user is also displayed.
